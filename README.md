## Description
This is my personal website that I use to showcase my projects. It is a static website built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript that uses the Flask framework to serve the pages.


To run this project locally, clone the repo to your local machine and run the ``server.py`` file. You will need to have python and flask installed on your machine.

## Installation

``pip install flask``
